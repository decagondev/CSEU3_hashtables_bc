# CSEU3 Hash Tables and Block Chain

# DAY 1 Components of a Hash Table
Today we will look at:
- what is a hash table. 
- what are the component parts of a hash table.

## What is a hash table?
We know them as objects in JavaScript and dictionaries in Python but they are an abstract data structure

## What are the component parts of a hash table?
Hash tables consist of a storage data structure and a hashing function under the hood. the base data structure we will use today will be using an Array or more specifically a Dynamic Array. We will discuss some differences today. Also contains a hashing function

# Day 2 Hash Table Collisions
Today we will look at:
- hashtable solution for yesterdays challenge (live code)
- break for 5 mins
- what are collisions (whiteboard & talk)
- break for 5 mins
- a way to handle collisions (whiteboard & code)
- break for 5 mins
- what your tasks for today are in the project repository

## Collisions
